# About Tw Classed

TwClassed was created by [Sanna Jammeh](https://twitter.com/SannaJammeh5) to improve the developer experience of creating design systems with Tailwind CSS and React. It's API is heavily inspired by [Stitches.js](https://stitches.dev) and aims to be as close to Stitches as possible.
