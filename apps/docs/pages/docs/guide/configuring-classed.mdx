# Configuring classed

Classed can be configured using the `createClassed` method.

The `createClassed` method takes a single argument, which is an object with the following properties:

```ts
interface ClassedConfig {
  merger: (...classes: string[]) => string;
}
```

The `merger` property is a function that takes a variable number of strings and returns a single string. This function is used to merge the class names together.

## Using a custom merger

Removing duplicates is not default behaviour. To enable it, you can pass a custom merger to the `createClassed` method.

```ts
// classed.config.ts
import { createClassed } from "@tw-classed/react";

// custom merger that removes duplicates using Set
const customMerger = (...classes: string[]) =>
  Array.from(new Set(classes)).join(" ");

export const { classed } = createClassed({ merger: customMerger });
```

## Using Tailwind merge

Tailwind merge is a 3rd party merger that removes duplicates and intelligently merges Tailwind classes by order of importance. This is especially useful when using the Variants API to override classes.

```ts
// classed.config.ts
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

import { createClassed } from "@tw-classed/react";

export const { classed } = createClassed({ merger: twMerge });
```

### In your components

```tsx
// Button.tsx
import { classed } from "classed.config";

const Button = classed.button({
  base: "py-2 px-4 rounded-md",
  variants: {
    color: {
      primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white",
      secondary: "bg-gray-500 text-white",
    },

    // If applied will override the base class, but may or may not be applied depending on the order of the classes that tailwind generates
    size: {
      small: "text-sm py-1 px-2",
      large: "text-lg py-3 px-5",
    },
  },

  defaultVariants: {
    color: "primary",
  },
});

() => <Button color="secondary" size="large" />;
```

### What happens here?

The `Button` component will be rendered with the following classes:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white text-lg py-3 px-5 rounded-md"></button>
```

This happens because of `tailwind-merge`, which intelligently merges the classes by order of importance. In this case, the `size` variant is applied after the `base` classes, so the `size` variant will override the `py-2 px-4` base classes.

Without the `tailwind-merge` merger, the `Button` component would be rendered with the following classes:

```html
<button
  class="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 text-lg py-3 px-5 rounded-md"
></button>
```

We dont know which classes will be applied first, so we can't be sure that the `size` variant will override the `base` classes.
