## Derived components

Sometimes you might have to extend a component with React logic. You can do this by creating a derived component.

A derived component might look like this:

1. A base `classed` component that adds styles & variants
2. A React component wrapping it that adds useful logic like icons, loading bars etc.

### `deriveClassed`

In order to create a wrapped component with a working `as` prop you must wrap it in `deriveClassed`. The function works similar to `React.forwardRef` and takes a callback that receives the props and a ref. The callback should **only** return the `classed` component you want to wrap.

A simple example looks like this:

```tsx
import { classed, deriveClassed, ComponentProps } from "@tw-classed/react";

const ButtonBase = classed.button({
  base: "px-2 py-4 flex items-center gap-2",
  variants: {
    color: {
      blue: "bg-blue-500 text-white",
      red: "bg-red-500 text-white",
    },
  },
});

export type ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ButtonBase> & {
  icon?: React.ReactNode; // Add an icon
};

export const Button = deriveClassed<typeof ButtonBase, ButtonProps>(
  ({ children, icon, ...rest }, ref) => {
    return (
      <ButtonBase {...rest} ref={ref}>
        {icon && <span>{icon}</span>}
        <span>{children}</span>
      </ButtonBase>
    );
  }
);

// In your App
import { CheckIcon, LinkIcon } from "example-icons";

() => <Button color="blue">Click me</Button>;
() => <Button icon={<CheckIcon />}>Click me</Button>;

// Use the `as` prop to change the rendered ButtonBase element
() => (
  <Button as="a" href="/" icon={<LinkIcon />}>
    Docs
  </Button>
);
```

In the example above we created a `Button` component that wraps the `ButtonBase` component. The `Button` component adds an icon and a span around the children. The `Button` component also accepts all props that the `ButtonBase` component accepts.

This is a very simple example, but you can use this pattern to add any kind of logic to your `classed` components.

**NOTE** The `ref` must be forwarded in your derived function.

### Experimental `As` manual prop support

The `deriveClassed` function also accepts a third argument to support the `as` prop manually in its render function. This is an experimental feature and might be removed in the future.

In order to use this feature you must pass the `as` prop type as the third generic argument to the `deriveClassed` function. This is to allow the compiler to infer the correct `as` prop type since its being manually set in the render function.

```tsx
export const Anchor = deriveClassed<typeof ButtonBase, ButtonProps, "a">( // Notice the third argument.
  ({ children, icon, ...rest }, ref) => {
    return (
      <ButtonBase as="a" {...rest} ref={ref}>
        {icon && <span>{icon}</span>}
        <span>{children}</span>
      </ButtonBase>
    );
  }
);
```

### Using the TypeScript `casting` API

A second option is to use the TypeScript `casting` API to cast the component to a strict component.

See the [TypeScript `casting` API](/docs/typescript#derivedcomponenttype---creating-a-derived-component) for more information.
