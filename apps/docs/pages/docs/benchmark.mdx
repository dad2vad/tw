# Benchmarks

Benchmarks measuring native `react`, `tw-classed`, `class-variance-authority` and `stitches.js`.
Keep in mind that `stitches.js` is a CSS-in-JS library, so it's not a fair comparison, but was added in order to see how tw-classed performs against the fastest CSS-in-JS library.

All benchmarks are performed on a 2021 Macbook Pro 13" with M1 chip and 8GB ram.

## Mounting and unmounting a button

Mounting and unmounting a button with variant props. Performed 1000x to get a stable result.

import ButtonVariantsBench from "../../components/benchmark/button-variants";

<ButtonVariantsBench />

When mounting and unmounting a button with variant props, `react` is the fastest (no shock here), followed by `cva` and `tw-classed`. `stitches.js` is the slowest.
