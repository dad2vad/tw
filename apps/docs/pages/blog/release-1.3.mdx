# Introducing TW Classed v1.3

Its now been little over a month since TW-Classed was released in v1.0.0. TW-Classed version 1.3 has introduced some exciting new features and improvements.

## New `createClassed` API

The most notable change is the introduction of the createClassed API, which allows users to create their own classed utility using a configuration object. This makes it easier to manage and reuse utility classes within a project. This is a future proofed API, which means that it will be able to support new features as they are added to TW-Classed. Currently only the `merger` prop is supported.

```ts
// classed.config.ts
import { createClassed } from "@tw-classed/react";

const noDuplicates = (classes: string[]) => [...new Set(classes)].join(" ");

export const { classed } = createClassed({
  merger: noDuplicates,
});
```

To read more about the createClassed API and how to use it, check out [this guide](/docs/guide/configuring-classed).

## Typescript interoperability between `core` & `react`

Another important addition is Typescript interoperability between the @tw-classed/core and @tw-classed/react packages. This allows developers to use @tw-classed/core in a framework-agnostic design system, and then use @tw-classed/react in their React application.

```tsx
// Design system
import { classed } from "@tw-classed/core";

export const button = classed({
  base: "bg-blue-500 text-white",
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: "px-2 py-1 text-sm",
      md: "px-3 py-2 text-base",
      lg: "px-4 py-3 text-lg",
    },
  },
});

// React application
import { button } from "design-system";
import { classed } from "@tw-classed/react";

export const Button = classed.button(button); // Variants & props are automatically inferred
```

## Support for additional classnames in `core`

The @tw-classed/core package now supports additional classnames, which allows developers to add additional classes to a classed utility. This is useful for adding classes that are not part of the classed utility, such as one-off classes.

```tsx
const button = classed("bg-blue-500 text-white");

() =>
  html`<button class="${button({ class: "flex items-center" })}">docs</button>`;
() =>
  html`<button class="${button({ className: "flex items-center" })}">
    docs
  </button>`;
```

## Other improvements

Other improvements in this release include the export of the ClassedConfig and DerivedComponentType types, as well as fixes for issues with `CJS` modules in Node.js and updates to dependencies.

Overall, TW-Classed version 1.3 continues to provide excellent developer experience while taking full advantage of the powerful utility classes offered by Tailwind CSS.
